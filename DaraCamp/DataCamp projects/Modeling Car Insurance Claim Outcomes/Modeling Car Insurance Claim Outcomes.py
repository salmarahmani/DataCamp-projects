# This script performs logistic regression on a dataset containing car insurance information to predict the outcome of car insurance claims.
# It imports necessary modules including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, and statsmodels for statistical modeling.
# The dataset "car_insurance.csv" is read into a DataFrame called 'cars'.
# Missing values in the 'credit_score' and 'annual_mileage' columns are filled with the mean of their respective columns.
# Logistic regression models are created for each feature individually to predict the outcome variable 'outcome'.
# Confusion matrices are computed for each model to calculate accuracy.
# The feature with the highest accuracy is identified, and its name along with the corresponding accuracy are stored in a DataFrame called 'best_feature_df'.
